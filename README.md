# Shiny

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions

## Installation

If you still havenâ€™t installed the Shiny package, open an R session, connect to the internet, and run

```bash
install.packages("shiny")
```

## Usage

```python
library(shiny)
```

## Structure of a Shiny App
Shiny apps are contained in a single script called ```app.R``` The script ```app.R``` lives in a directory (for example, newdir/) and the app can be run with ```runApp("newdir")```
